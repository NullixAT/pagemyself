title: Extended Functionality
---

You probably already have learned how to build themes and page-blocks, but you want to take it to a deeper level?

The module which creates this documentation you currently read uses where extended functionality.

For example it creates custom pages, has a special cronjob for syncing, has a own special theme to create this documentation, and many more...

It combines flebility with PageMyself features seamlessly. For reference, please check out [this repositories source code](https://github.com/NullixAT/pagemyself-docs). If you have further questions, open an issue or join our Slack chat.
