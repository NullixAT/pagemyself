## PageMyself - Open Source Self Hosted WYSIWYG Website Builder

> We try to give you the tools to create your private/company website in no time and without coding skills. Once setup, it is almost as easy as writing an office document.

### Alpha

This app is currently in alpha. You can already download and install. We have
a [docker setup](https://github.com/NullixAT/pagemyself-docker) as well, where you get this running inside docker with a
few commands.

### Live Demo

We have a [live demo here](https://demo.pagemyself.com/). Try PageMyself yourself. The demo reset's automatically every
full hour and all data is purged. Please do not abuse this service or we must shutdown the demo. Login credentials are
on the demo homepage itself. If the page is destroyed or credentials are missing, just wait for the next full hour.

### Features

* Self-hosted and open source
* WYSIWYG | What you see is what you get | Live edit text and other information directly on the homepage
* Highly customizable | The whole page design can be changed very detailed, it may be a bit overhelming at first but we
  are working on a good tutorial series
* Easy installation | Setup just take minutes | Choose of multiple installation methods
* :heart: for devs | Built from the ground up for developers to integrate own themes, modules and plugins
* Multilanguage interface | Currently there is english and german, but plan is to integrate open-source translations as
  well

### Usage tutorial

We are working on [a short youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFckrKcNoDynWKpyM-_Zc6r-UjLA-BiX8)
that show installation and usage of PageMyself. Please give us some time. A
first [quick overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDBCgJ9qzvI&list=PLFckrKcNoDynWKpyM-_Zc6r-UjLA-BiX8) is
already available.

### Installation 

We have a documentation page for [PageMyself installation here](https://pagemyself.com/docs).

### Team

This project was created by me, [brainfoolong](https://github.com/brainfoolong). I hope that this evolves and the
open-source team can grow. I do this in my spare time beside my full-time job as a web-dev. Let us discus about ideas
here in Github issues or you can join [my slack chat](https://scripts.0x.at/github-webhooks/slack-join/). I try to be as
active as possible.

### Based on Framelix

This project is based on the [PHP 8.1+ Framework: Framelix](https://github.com/NullixAT/framelix-core) which is
primarely designed for backend applications but also work well for PageMyself as it is highly customizable.

### Theme and Module Development

We have a code documentation page for [PageMyself here](https://pagemyself.com/docs).
